## Background
For this project, I was looking to add additional communication methods to the Lockheed Martin website. The current website has contact us page, however it only provides phone numbers and email addresses. Therefore, I have created a version of the Lockheed Martin website and added 2 additional web pages that would allow visitors to communicate with Lockheed either through a contacts page or a live chat as an alternative method of making contact.
