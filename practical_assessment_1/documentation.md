## Background
For this project, I was looking to add additional communication methods to the Lockheed Martin website. The current website has contact us page, however it only provides phone numbers and email addresses. Therefore, I have created a version of the Lockheed Martin website and added 2 additional web pages that would allow visitors to communicate with Lockheed either through a contacts page or a live chat as an alternative method of making contact.

## Colour Choices
For the colour choices, I kept it simple and tried to use the same colour as the Lockheed Martin's logo to keep in line with the colour scheme. With the contrasting blue and white will allow text to be visible under the nav bar and kept a simple black and white for the text in the background for legibility.

## Accessibility
Once the website was completed, it was checked over using the [Easy Checks â€“ A First Review of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/test-evaluate/preliminary/) to ensure that the website has high level of accessibility as possible.

### Page Titles
Confirmed that each web pages have been allocated a page title.

### Images
Confirmed pages that contain images have alternative text to convey the purpose of the images.

### Headings
Confirmed each page has at least a h1 heading and any subsequent headings, if any, are implemented in a meaningful hierarchy.

### Contrast Ratio
Confirmed text contrast ratio is sufficient to allow readability for all users.

### Text Resizing
Confirmed texts can be resized without distortion over other objects on the website

### Keyboard Access and Visual Focus
Confirmed that all clickable objects can be selected through the use of tab to allow control via keyboard.

### Forms, Labels, and Errors
Confirmed that all text entry fields have keyboard access, contains labels to identify them and also uses the required attribute to create a pop-up message to notify the user to fill in the field before submitting.
